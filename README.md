I had so much fun making my last project, which was a basic stock price prediction program, that I decided to do something very similar and create a crypto currency price prediction program.

It’s always so satisfying to watch programs like this train themselves with the data I feed it. Some people think it’s boring, and I totally get that, but for me I am always in awe as I watch my programs comb through massive amounts of information so quickly. Machine Learning truly amazes me more and more every day.

This project was actually extremely easy to create, as all I had to do was piggy-back off my last project and change a few lines here and there. Somehow though this prediction model turned out MUCH more accurate than the stock price predictions in my last project.

In fact, this one is accurate enough I feel compelled to include a disclaimer (Which you can find at the top of the post).

With that being said, the predictions have not been dead on, but they have been close enough that I see the potential to make something that could actually assist me in my personal investment decisions. 

The good news about making most of the machine learning projects I have worked on so far is that by tweaking a few key parameters you can drastically influence the accuracy of the model and predictions.

As with my last project, if you are interested and want to learn more about how this program actually works, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or LinkedIn and I will do my best to explain it to you or answer any questions you have about it.
